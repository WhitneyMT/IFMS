<h1>Integrated Fleet Management System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The g-FleeT identified a need to replace the strategic business system, i.e., the Fleet Information System (FIS), as it was outdated and no longer scalable. The FIS, in its existing form, could no longer be maintained or enhanced to fulfill the business needs of g-FleeT and its clients. This legacy system was outsourced and privately developed by a third party in 1993. Initially, the system was developed as a desktop environment and evolved over the years as the business matured. To keep up with business growth, the system was enhanced and migrated to a server platform without following any standardized architecture. This resulted in a lack of project management methodology, business impact analysis, clear programming languages, coding standards, reference documentation, and user manuals.

These issues largely contributed to the system's failure and underperformance. The Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) and the Gauteng Audit Services (GAS) continuously raised these concerns as audit findings. In an effort to address the weaknesses identified in the system, g-FleeT spent approximately R9,791,517.29 over the past eight (8) financial years on maintenance.

The underlying technology used to build the FIS was based on outdated assumptions and required a complete overhaul to align with current internet technologies. The system operated on a Java and SQL software platform database and a Microsoft operating system. Additionally, due to the unreliability of the technologies on which the FIS was developed, the system posed a significant risk to the Entity, as it was a business-critical system.

The FIS did not conform to new technologies and standards introduced since its implementation. Furthermore, there were significant technological gaps, and the FIS did not align with business requirements and processes. For example, it was not integrated with g-FleeT’s business objectives regarding billing and payments, AARTO compliance, traffic fines, license renewal, acquisition, disposal, reporting, and other essential functions.

The known business issues were as follows:

  - Aging FIS – an in-house built system that had been evolving since 1994 over a period of two decades.
  - System overload – the system was originally built for 300 vehicles, while g-FleeT had more than 6,000 vehicles.
  - Manual intervention – excessive manual intervention was required, leading to inaccurate and manipulated data.
  - Technical and human intervention – the system was not user-friendly. Over two decades, it had evolved with little or no maintenance from a technical management perspective. Technical issues included the     
    server on which the FIS ran, where operational downtime could have been prevented if issues had been anticipated before failure.
  - Lack of system integration – the system did not interact with any other systems. Crucial data from tracker information was not integrated, reducing the quality and reliability of management information.
  - Lack of proper business processes – the system was not designed to enhance g-FleeT’s turnaround times or improve processes.

The following were the objectives:

  - To implement an integrated fleet management solution built on the latest technology.
  - To eliminate system overload and manual intervention by automating all the modules on the IFMS.
  - To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes.
  - To enable real-time reporting and dashboard functionality.

This project is still in progress, it is not complete.
